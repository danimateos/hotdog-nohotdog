    "Hi there! Welcome back to this series on Deep Learning for image classification. In the two previous installments about [imagenet and deep learning], and [the train-test split], we managed to get the images we need to build a [sweet sweet hotdog/nohotdog classifier] using [Deep Learning]. This time, we are finally going to play around with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! But wait, what are those???\n",

    "The form our classifier is going to take is the [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](). These have revolutionized image classification and a lot of other tasks. Remember the 2012 Imagenet challenge?? This is the innovation that changed everyting. \n",
    "\n",
    "As any other Neural Network, CNNs consist of a series of stacked layers. Each layer consists of a series of neurons. These are simply nodes in a network that hold a floating point value, called their __activation__. Each node in a layer is connected to the layer immediately below, and the connection has a __weight__ associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest kind of layer that we can think of is one in which each neuron is connected to __all__ the neurons in the preceding layer. This is called a [Dense](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense) layer. In it, the activation of each neuron will be calculated from the sum of the activations of every single neuron in the previous layer, each multiplied by the corresponding weight. But that sum is not the activation itself; the activation will be calculated from that sum by applying an _activation function_.\n",

    "# Activation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have just seen, the connection between a neuron and the layer below is shaped by an _activation function_. This describes the relationship between the values in the preceding layer, the weights, and the activation value. For each neuron its activation $a_i$ will be determined by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_i = f(\\sum_j^n(a_i w_{ij}))$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "That $f$ is the activation function. There are a number of them that can be used without changing terribly how the NN performs. The requisites are basically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The activation function must be nonlinear. If it was, the whole network would be just a chain of matrix multiplications, and the output would be a linear function of the output. We could save all the trouble and just summarize the whole thing with a single multiplication. And, obviously, it wouldn't learn anything useful. The fun in NNs is that they are [Universal Function Approximators](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The activation function must be differentiable. That is crucial for our gradient descent (remember [the last post](TODO: internal link)): we need the derivative, the gradient, to know in what direction we need to push the weights in every step of the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "An early function that was widely used is the logistic function, the same used in logistic regression. If you think about it, then the expression above is exactly logistic regression. Therefore, a neural network can be thought of as a series of logistic regressions stacked one over the other!\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, the current most used activation function is the [Rectified Linear Unit](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning) (ReLu), but at this level the distinction is mostly academic. We don't need to go into the practical or theoretical differences between the ReLu and the logistic to get a general understanding of how NNs work."

    "In logistic regression, we pick the coefficients (corresponding to our _weights_ here) to minimize an error measure given a set of inputs and corresponding outputs. If we had an error measure here, we could adjust the weights so that the error measure for each input is minimized. But we do! it is the difference (measured in any of a number of ways) between the predictions of the network and the true classes. That will work for the last layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about the bottom layers? Well, if we had a perfect last hidden layer, then the previous one would have to predict its activations for a given input. Then, the error measure is the difference between the output of the previous and the \"perfect\" hidden layer! We can apply this reasoning to adjust the weights of each layer from the top to the bottom (back), for each layer in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is just that! A fancy way of saying: adjust by one step of gradient descent the last layer, then the second-to-last in view of those last layer weights, and so on until you reach the bottom. Rinse and repeat until you are satisfied with the results. This is the breakthrough that made neural networks trainable."

    "We've been talking about neural networks like there was only one kind. However, the recent explosion in Deep Learning performance and width of application is due in no small part to the invention of a variety of network kinds which are especially suited to particular tasks. In our specific application, image classification, and more generally in computer vision the kind that suits us best is the Convolutional Neural Network. This is a network that includes one or more [convolutional layers](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv2d).\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional layer differs from a dense layer in that each neuron in it doesn't look at the whole layer below it but only to a small region of it, often 3 x 3 or 5 x 5. That means that the first convolutional layer will look at squares of 9 or 25 pixels in much the same way that a neuron in a dense layer looks at its whole input layer. That results first in a huge reduction in number of parameters, which could explode with the kind of input sizes that an image classifier must handle - remember, each pixel in the image will result in three nodes in the input layer! this is a great bonus, but not the main point. The real advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Translation invariance: a neuron in a convolutional layer will learn to be activated in response to a particular visual feature. It will not care where that feature is: a neuron that recognizes vertical edges will recognize them anywhere in the image. \n",

It is a library built specifically for Deep Learning on Python by Fran√ßois Chollet and others. It runs on top of different backends, like Theano and Tensorflow. These are amazing libraries, but not the kind of thing that you want to deal with if you want to build your first prototype and iterate on it fast.
